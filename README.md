# Book2Meet - Appointment Booking System

This website will allow a user to schedule meetings with other
users. 

This system integrates with existing calendar systems (e.g.
Google) and ensure that meetings can be booked at appropriate times
without clashes. 

Meetings can be cancelled or moved, and are
able to recur daily, weekly, monthly, etc. 

A booking system similar to
other popular choices, where a user can create a link/page that allows other users to
arrange meetings within approved time windows, should also be
implemented.
